App Brainstorming
===

## Activity 1

### Ideas Brainstorm

1. Journaling app w/ mood tracker
    A journal with a calendar view as well as buttons to press with how you're feeling at the moment/ day. The app will automatically track the date and time of logs, as well as send notifications throughout the day for you to log your thoughts and mood. It'll be a "What's on your mind?" type of journalling app where users can simply log their random thoughts and review them later.
    
    
2. Auto-generated flashcards 
You'll give the app either a topic, copy and paste classnotes, or upload a document (perhaps a syllabus). This will be parsed through an LLM via an API. The LLM will find key words and concepts from the information you give it and return a list of key words and definitions in a JSON to the app. The app will create the flashcards so the front will have the word(s) and when you tap, you'll flip the card over and see the definition.

    In the future, the app could have reminders for spaced repition as well as quiz you and track which cards you're not yet familiar with.
    
3. Breathing excercises on your own terms
Instead of being guided through a breathing excercise and perhaps not be able to keep up, you're guided through a breathing excercise, but you can do it at your own terms. When you breathe in, you'll press and hold on a button, and when you breathe out, you'll release. This would allow a user to track their breath and habits while doing breathing excercises. The hope is for users to be able to see improvements in mindful breathing over time. Whale themed for fun.

    In the future, the app could connect to Apple Health and Apple Watch so heart rate can also be tracked while you do the breathing excercises. Additionally, in-depth analytics on the user's habits and patterns could be added.

#### top 2 app ideas: breathing excercises & random thoughts journal

### Evaluate and Categorize
#### Breathing Excercises
- **Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
    - Relies on touch gestures (press + hold) which are intuitive and tactile
    - Uses haptics and animations to simulate breathing — features unique to phones
    - In future, can integrate with Apple Watch/HealthKit, reinforcing mobile-first experience

- **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
    - Inspired by my own experience with breathwork, anxiety, and burnout over the past two years (an extremely sellable but real story)
    - Provides a gentle, whimsical alternative to strict breathing timers — you're in control
    - Has a distinct emotional hook with theming — the whale + feedback loop = calm + play
    
- **Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
    - No existing app gives the user full control over their breathing pace in a visual/tactile way
    - Competes in wellness/mental health space, which is large and growing, but differentiates via interactivity and ownership
    - Can be appealing to those with anxiety, ADHD, or sensory needs

- **Habit:** How habit forming or addictive is this app?
    - Immediate soothing feedback makes it easy to return to during moments of stress
    - Could build habit with gentle streaks, animations, or encouraging messages
    - Later versions could use reminders, goal setting, or Apple Health integrations

- **Scope:** How well formed is the scope of this app?
    - MVP is clear and achievable: press + release with haptic + simple feedback
    - Analytics screen is bonus but scoped-down (just logs exhale time + sessions)
    - Whale animations can be simple at first, with opportunity to polish later

#### Journaling App with Mood Tracker
- **Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
    - Journaling and mood tracking are both well-suited for short mobile interactions
    - Uses notifications and on-the-go prompts to encourage real-time reflections
    - Takes advantage of calendar view, system date/time, and possibly voice input

- **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
    - Everyone has thoughts they want to jot down — this app gives a low-pressure outlet
    - Combines journaling + mood in a way that helps users understand emotional trends

- **Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
    - Competes with apps like Daylio, Moodnotes, and Stoic — but...
        - Most journaling apps are busy and serious -- most want you to write a diary entry as opposed to a single random thought

- **Habit:** How habit forming or addictive is this app?
    - Notification nudges keep users engaged
    - Seeing your past moods/thoughts over time creates a sense of narrative


- **Scope:** How well formed is the scope of this app?
    - MVP is clean: logging text + mood emoji + automatic timestamp
    - Optional features (calendar, tag search, charts) can come later
    - Low visual complexity = can focus on UX and polish


### final decision: breathing excercises
