## Overview

### Description
whexhale is a playful breathing exercise app where users control their breathing through press-and-hold gestures. Instead of being forced to follow rigid breathing patterns, users "breathe on their own terms" ‚Äî pressing and releasing a whale character to simulate inhale and exhale. The whale animates and sprays water on exhale, giving calming, tactile feedback. The app logs breath durations and visualizes trends on a simple stats screen.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health & Wellness / Mindfulness
- **Mobile:** Highly mobile; leverages touch, haptics, animation, and gesture control
- **Story:** Based on my needs; invites playful, emotional regulation
- **Market:** Few apps offer freeform, user-led breath tracking with delightful UX
- **Habit:** Encourages regular calming check-ins, especially during stress
- **Scope:** MVP is achievable (breathing + feedback + analytics); scalable with stretch features and other tools catered towards anxiety attacks
